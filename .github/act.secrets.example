# ACT secrets example (local runs)
#
# Copy this file to .github/act.secrets and edit locally as needed.
# The file is gitignored by default. Do NOT commit real secrets.
#
# Format: one KEY=VALUE per line. These become GitHub Actions `secrets.*`
# when running under nektos/act with `--secret-file .github/act.secrets`.
#
# Note: For this repository, local ACT runs are designed to skip login/push
# and artifact uploads. A secrets file is optional and can be empty.
# Provide values only if you intentionally test authenticated paths locally.

# Examples (commented out by default):
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# GHCR_USERNAME=your-gh-username
# GHCR_PASSWORD=your-ghcr-password-or-token
# DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
# DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=your-dockerhub-password
